## Installation
There is no installation. Simply copy/paste the code into your Python IDE of choice and run. The only modules that are required that do not come with Python by default is the PySimpleGUI module. Please see https://www.pysimplegui.org/en/latest/#pysimplegui-users-manual for installation instructions. 

## Usage
### Terminal Version:

Copy/paste the code into a Python IDE and run the file. The terminal will ask the requirements of your passwords. Answer yes/y for required, no/n for not required. 

### GUI Version:

Copy/paste the code into a python interpretor and run the file (requires PySimpleGUI). Select the requirements of your password by checking the checkboxes. Press generate and a window will pop up with your password.

## Roadmap
Currently looking to improve the structure and design of the code in the following ways:
1. Add options to remove certain characters from the password that are too similar (I and l for example)
2. Improve
